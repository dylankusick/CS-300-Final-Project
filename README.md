# CS-300-Final-Project
Includes the files needed to run the final project as well as a README file



    What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    The work that I did for these projects outlined how I could use different data structures to make a program that holds information about college courses. The first project explained three different data structures: vectors, binary search trees, and hash tables. While each have their pros and cons, I decided to use a vector. Project two implemented the vector, which stored the information for course data. The project required  the courses to be in alphanumeric order if the full list of courses was printed out, and also required a search that would print out a specific course with prerequisites if they existed. 
    
    
    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
    I approached the problem by outlining the pros and cons of each data structure. I found that the time complexity of the vector would not matter much for this small project. Data structures are important to understand because when working with different sets of data, one may be a better suit for the information as it could traverse faster, or be better if the storage needs to be resized.
    
    
    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    I overcame most of the roadblocks I encountered by referring back to previous coursework. I also like to step away from the code as it helps me think about new solutions instead of trying to force the wrong solutions. 
    
    
    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    This project has expanded my approach to design software by forcing me to learn new concepts and apply them. The development process was definitely a bit harder but a good outline of how the program was supposed to work supported my efforts immensely. 
    
    
    How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    The way I write programs has been changed by again, forcing me to understand how new concepts work. Getting a good foundation, or understanding all of the things I would need to implement goes a long way. It is hard to code a program with no understanding of the flow or how each function is supposed to be implemented.
